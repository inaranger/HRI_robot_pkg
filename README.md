#HRI-Pipeline - Robotic Arm component - HRI_robot_pkg

A Python library for controlling a robotic arm. This component controls the Franka Emika Panda robotic arm using Deoxys to pick up distinct bricks by position.

## Overview

This library is one of two components in a complete multimodal manipulation system developed for a Bachelor's thesis. It handles:

- brick detection using YOLO
- 6D pose estimation using FoundationPose
- computing the optimal grip
- collision checking using pybullet
- manipulation using inverse kinematics and the Deoxys library

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20
- Python 3.10+
- [FoundationPose](https://github.com/NVlabs/FoundationPose) installation
- [Deoxys](https://github.com/UT-Austin-RPL/deoxys_control) installation
- YOLO model file (`best.pt`)
- [Conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for the setup virtual enviorement
- Additional dependencies found within `robot-pkg.yml`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/inaranger/HRI_robot_pkg
cd hri_robot_pkg
```
2. Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:
```bash
conda env create -f robot-pkg.yml
```

3. Activate the Virtual environment
```bash
conda activate robot-pkg
```

4. Substitute files from external libraries with our [files to replace](https://github.com/inaranger/HRI_robot_pkg/tree/main/files_to_replace) 
- The deoxys charmander.ymlcontrol_config.yml (in deoxys_control/deoxys/config)
- The deoxys motion_utils.py (in deoxys_control/deoxys/deoxys/experimental) to include the gripper width 
- The Yolo results.py (in ultralytics/ultralytics/engine) and plotting.py(in ultralytics/ultralytics/utils/plotting.py) have been modified to show the match the bounding box color to the brick color 


5. Download required models:
   - Place YOLO mask model `best.pt` in `src/` directory

### Docker
To make this system compatible with newer GPU's. a Docker Repository was implemented for NVIDIA RTX GPU 5090 running both foundationpose and Deoxys compatible with new Drivers (Cuda 12.8.1). The Installation with Docker works as follows:
1. Get the Docker container
```bash
docker pull inaranger/deoxys-foundationpose:latest
```

2. Start the docker container
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /cshome:/cshome -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --net=host -v /home/ipnagias/workspace:/home/workspace --gpus all --name pddd --privileged deoxys-foundationpose
```

3. Follow the steps 1. through 5. of the normal installation process 

**Note**: As pytorch3d does not support pip, we had to build and install it from a local clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d
Install Infos: https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md 

## Quick Start

### 1. Go to the franka web interface: https://172.16.0.2

### 2. Unlock all joints and activate FCI

### 3. Run the scripts in deoxys_control/deoxys/auto_scripts:   
  ./auto_arm.sh ../config/charmander.yml ../config/control_config.yml  
  ./auto_gripper.sh ../config/charmander.yml ../config/control_config.yml  
  You can use the helper scripts: [run_arm](./src/run_arm.sh) and [run_gripper](./src/run_gripper.sh), if you change the target directory to your version of deoxys.
  
### 4. Start the Interaction System
```bash
cd src
python3 -m start_robot
```

## Configuration

### Camera Calibration
To calibrate the camera (Intel RealSense) mounted on top of the robot, place a camera calibration board on the table and run this script
```bash
python3 -m start_robot --calibrate
```

## Core Components

### Main Scripts
- **`start_robot.py`**: Main script - run this to start interaction
- **`robot_functions.py`**: Defines executable functions
- **`real_sense_reader.py`**: Handles image capturing from the Intel RealSense camera
- **`intel_publisher.py`**: Can stream the camera images and publish them to the AriaPC via ZMQ


## Architecture
This component operates as part of a two-part system:

1. **[Multimodal data streaming component](https://github.com/inaranger/HRI_aria-nlp_pkg):** Streams and processes data from the Meta Aria glasses
2. **Robot Component (this package):** Handles robot control
   
The components communicate through a distributed architecture using ZeroMQ for efficient inter-process communication.
